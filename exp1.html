<p style="color:white;"> Digital electronics is a field of electronics involving the study of digital signals and the engineering of devices that use or produce them. This is in contrast to analog electronics and analog signals.The combinational digital logic systems are fundamentally built using logic gates such as OR gate, AND gate, universal gates NOR and NAND gate, NOT gate. These gates are merged to develop complex switching circuits. The logic gate is built of multiple combinational logic circuits. In a combinational logic system, the output can be delivered at any time based on the given input at a correct instant time and combinational techniques donâ€™t hold any memory devices. The sequential digital system is varied from combinational logic systems. Here the output of any logic device is not based on the given input to the component and depends on past given inputs. In other terms, the output of sequential circuits based on the given inputs and the present state of the device. The sequential circuits have memory components to save the past output. Here the sequential circuits are simple circuits like a combinational circuit with memory devices and developed using finite-state circuits. It is like flip flops and counters and built using logic memory and gates. The two input is processed by combinational circuits to give different outputs. The output obtained from the memory components is given to combinational circuits. The secondary input components are state variables generated by storage components and secondary devices are used for exciting the storage elements.
